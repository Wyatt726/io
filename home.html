        <p>My name is Wyatt Orman, I am 26 years old and was born and raised in the greater Oakland town of Antioch, CA. <br>
            I am currently living in Hubert, NC, with my wife Shelby, and two dogs Chewy and Sadie.<br>
            When I was 19, I joined the USMC and served until a week before my 26th birthday. <br>
            During my time in the service, I spent five years stationed in 29 Palms, CA where I <br>
            was a forward observer, company level intelligence cell leader, as well as machine gun <br>
            section assistant leader for the "lucky" rifle company, weapons section of 3RD BN 4TH Marines. <br>
            During my time in "lucky" company, I deployed to Australia for a year, where I trained the <br>
            ADF as well as French Paratroopers. When I was 22, a year after returning from Australia, I was <br>
            headed to Afghanistan. I spent 9 months total in Helamnd Province and 7 of that was in the heart <br>
            of the notorious Sangin Valley District. Once I returned home all in one peice, I received a <br>
            special duty assignement to serve in USCYBERCOM under the NSA. This is where I began my journey <br>
            in the world of cyber. I spent my first year learning the new skills I would have to behold in <br>
            order to efficentatly do my job. I served as an All Source Intelligence Analyst as well as <br>
            offensive cyber operations targeteer. After two years in the NSA, I had decieded my time in <br>
            the military was ready for a close, which is when I moved to NC and began my software developer <br>
            journey with devCodeCamp. </p>
